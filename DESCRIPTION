Description: A collection of routines for finding reference limits using, where appropriate, 
  QQ methodology.  All use a data vector X of cases from the reference population.  
  The default is to get the central 95% reference range   of the population, namely 
  the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile.  
   * In some settings we want the 99% range. 
   * Sometimes we want only one of these limits – for example the upper 95% point.  
   * Along with the reference limit, we want a confidence interval which, 
   for historical reasons, is typically at 90% confidence.  A full analysis 
   provides six numbers:
      – the upper and the lower reference limits, and 
      - each of their confidence intervals.
