Description: A collection of routines for finding reference limits using, where 
    appropriate, QQ methodology.  All use a data vector X of cases from the 
    reference population. The default is to get the central 95% reference range 
    of the population, namely the 2.5 and 97.5 percentile, with optional 
    adjustment of the range.  Along with the reference limits, we want 
    confidence intervals which, for historical reasons, are typically at 90% 
    confidence.  A full analysis provides six numbers:
      â€“ the upper and the lower reference limits, and 
      - each of their confidence intervals.
